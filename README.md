The 'Swoompipe' is a weird MIDI bagpipe. It's squeezable (via Flex Sensor), blow-into-able (via Electret Mic), tilt-sensing (via Accelerometer) and playable with 12 Capacitive Keys.

It's being developed by Ben Neal (Psicon Lab) for Swoomptheeng as part of a Birmingham City University Maker Monday Commission.
